Under normal circumstances, if BTC increases by 1%, btc3l increases by 3%, btc3s increases by - 3%, the actual situation is calculated according to the net value. Net value = net value at the last adjustment time point * Γ ± n * (latest spot transaction price - price at the last adjustment time point) / price at the last adjustment time point * 100%, (\"n\" stands for ETF leverage ratio); net value is normally adjusted at 0:00 every day, and the extreme market will be adjusted in the intraday, and the corresponding management fee will be charged for each leverage. Please check the net value before trading, and the product is in the extreme market There will be the risk that the price tends to zero and the price deviates from the net value.
